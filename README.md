# RacePygame
A simple turtle racing game built with Python's `turtle` module. Two turtles race based on dice rolls, with a circular finish line to mark the end!

## ðŸŽ² How It Works

- Each player (turtle) rolls a virtual dice once at the start.
- The dice value determines how far the turtle moves per step.
- First to reach the circular finish line wins!

## ðŸ§© Features

- Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `turtle` and `random` modules
- Two colorful players (green and blue turtles)
- Random dice roll affects each turtle's speed
- Real-time race visualization

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x (no additional libraries required)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Save the script as `turtle_race.py`
2. Run it with:
   ```bash
   python turtle_race.py
